Cellen-Tellen is a free and open-source software developed as a side-project.
As such, **it comes "as is" with no warranty of any kind**. That being said, 
its developer will gladly do their best to maintain it and fix any bug brought 
to his attention, within reasonable limits.

When encountering a problem with Cellen-Tellen, please **first thoroughly read 
the [Installation](installation.markdown) and [Usage](usage.markdown) 
sections**. If you cannot find information about your problem there, check if 
it isn't listed in **the [Common problems](#common-problems) section below**. 
If you still cannot find anything, you can also check **the 
[Issues](https://github.com/WeisLeDocto/Cellen-Tellen/issues) and 
[Discussions](https://github.com/WeisLeDocto/Cellen-Tellen/discussions) pages**
of the GitHub repository.

If your problem has never been reported before, **the best way to report it is
to [open a new issue](https://github.com/WeisLeDocto/Cellen-Tellen/issues/new) 
on GitHub**. Issues are not only intended for bugs, they can also be opened for
requesting help or suggesting improvements. Alternatively, you can also 
**[start a new discussion](https://github.com/WeisLeDocto/Cellen-Tellen/discussions/new/choose)
on GitHub** for chatting with the maintainer in a more informal way. Both of 
these solutions require you to 
[create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join). If for some reason you 
would absolutely refuse to create a GitHub account, you can also 
<a href="mailto:antoine.weisrock@gmail.com">email the maintainer</a>, although
I would prefer you not to contact me this way.
