As a Python module, Cellen-Tellen can be installed on almost any computer able
to run a version of Python between 3.7 and 3.10. It is in particular fully 
supported on **Windows 8 and later**, and on **Ubuntu 18.04 and later**. 

Because the installation and use as a Python module might not be 
straightforward for every user, a very **basic Windows installer** is also 
provided for convenience.

# On Windows

# On Linux and macOS

## Check your Python version

On both Linux and macOS, Python is natively installed. In a terminal, you can
check the current version of Python as follows :

```console
user@machine:~$ python --version
Python 3.10.6
```

Or, in cases where both Python 2 and 3 are installed :

```console
user@machine:~$ python3 --version
Python 3.10.6
```

If the current version of Python is not between 3.7 and 3.10, you will need to
install another version matching the specification. This can be done using
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) on macOS, or 
[other workarounds](https://hackersandslackers.com/multiple-
python-versions-ubuntu-20-04/) in Ubuntu.

## \[Optional] Deploy a virtual environment
